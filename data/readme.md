In this folder, we provide a sampled data in a train-test-valid split style.
Things to note:
 - In actual experiments, we conducted a 10-fold-cv. You may wish to also do 5cv or 10cv so as to avoid cherry picking.
 - None of these data is collected by us. All credits to prior works. please refer to the paper where we provided our full citations.
 - This is just a sampled subset of all datasets for various reasons: 
 1. tweets on Twitter will eventually disappear due to deletion/suspension. 
 2. Other postings may be too short/long. 
 3. Some postings are not English while we focused on English postings, etc. 
 4. We have to balance the number of positive and negative instances.
 5. We tried our best in recovering these posts and applied our own filtering criteria. One may check our paper for detailed processes.
